# NYC-Parks-Monuments-Final

Reasons for changes in OpenRefine: <br>
- Mass Edit Changes in Borough Column 
  - Streamlining the spelling and style of the writing, adding in some that weren't there. This was important to note where the monuments were.
- Mass edit Cast Column
  - I thought that this mean't when the monument was made but then I later realized that I should've been actually looking for installation
- Mass Edit Installation
  - I was going to use this to figure out when art pieces were made to try to understand what type of period art is prominent throughout New York.
  - I changed it to just be years so that it'd be more streamlined and easier to tell rather than randome dates although there wasn't that much information anyways
